# ThumbHash Generator

This project demonstrates how to generate a ThumbHash from an image using Node.js. The ThumbHash is a compact visual representation of an image, which can be used to create fast-loading, low-resolution thumbnails.

## Prerequisites

-   Node.js installed on your system.
-   An image file you want to generate a ThumbHash for.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.

2. Install the required dependencies by running:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

1. Place your image file in the images directory. By default, the script uses an image named combo-image.png, but you can change this in the index.js file.

2. Run the script to generate a ThumbHash: `node index.js `

`ThumbHash (Base64): <your-thumbhash-base64-string> `
